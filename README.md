This project aims to create a website to connect buyer and consumer of vegetable oils which are rendered useless 
after a certain amount of time.
Collecting this waste cooking oil from these FBOs in return for some incentive and providing the biodiesel industries with
these raw materials. FBOs will be willing to be a part of this as they'll be getting money for waste.
And, the biodiesel industries will be willing to be a part of this as well as they will be getting their raw materials for a 
much cheaper price than what is industry-standard.
